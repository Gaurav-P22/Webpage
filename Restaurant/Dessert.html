    <H2>Chocolate Chip Mint Ice Cream Cookies</H2>
    <img src="Choco.jpg" alt="Not Available" id="choco" class="img">
    <p>Mint and chocolate is a pairing that just seems like a match made in heaven – or maybe that’s just me. Buying ice cream sandwiches from the grocery store tends to result in something bland and flavorless, but making them yourself using real cookies and ice cream results in a much richer and tastier dessert.

        At the same time, you also have the option of tailoring it to your own taste, by choosing the type of cookies and the flavor of ice cream that you use in the dessert.</p>

        <h2>Tiramisu Cupcakes</h2>
        <img src="Tri.jpg"  alt="Not available" id="tri" class="img">
        <p>Traditionally, tiramisu is a slice and a pretty popular one at that. But, who says that’s all a tiramisu can be? After all, the general flavors of coffee, cocoa, mascarpone and sugar can be combined in a range of different, very effective, ways.

            A tiramisu cupcake is just one example of this and when done right the cupcakes really do taste like a mini tiramisu. They can also look both appealing and unique, making them a good approach for impressing dinner guests.
            
            Besides, cupcakes are a great way to make tiramisu a little bit different.</p>
            <h2>Warm Belgian Waffles And Ice Cream</h2>
            <img src="Warm.jpg" id="warm" alt="Not Available" class="img">
            <p>Belgian waffles are one type of dessert that is simply not made often enough in the United States. This type of waffle differs from the traditional American waffle in a few ways.

                It uses a lighter batter and tends to have larger squares and deeper pockets along with a larger overall size. Serving the waffle warm with ice cream turns it into an appealing and luxurious dessert item. Confectioners’ sugar and fresh fruit are also often included to make the dish even more special.</p>
                <h2>Oreo Cheesecake</h2>
                <img src="Oreo.jpg" id="oreo" alt="Not Available" class="img">
                <p>Oreo cheesecakes do a great job of combining two very appealing foods into one. Typically this type of cheesecake is very easy to make and many of the recipes out there don’t even require baking.

                    This makes the cheesecake a good choice if you have to bring dessert to an event or if you simply don’t have much time. The color contrast with an Oreo cheesecake also works really well, because the cheesecake ends up standing out. Any dark chocolate sauce will also add to this effect</p>
                    <h2>Apple Cinnamon Mini-Pies</h2>
                    <img src="Apple.jpg" id="apple" alt="Not Available" class="img">
                    <p>Making a pie can be a big endeavor and you almost always end up with much more pie than you actually want or need. Mini-pies are a fantastic way around this, because these are single serving pies that are fairly easy to make.

                        Often you can make these in muffin tins, which cuts down on the mess and the effort. Another cool thing is that the small size makes mini pies, like this apple cinnamon pie, very easy to decorate and you can make each individual pie look appealing and professional</p>
